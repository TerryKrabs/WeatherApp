Weather Sprint Day 5
I believe this was my worst assignment so far. It's been difficult getting accustumed to JavaScript, and the css for this assignment was not as easy as I originally thought it would be. I tried switching my api's to Async functions, but I didnt have much luck. I glad that this assignment was due at the end of level 1, becuase it gives me time to study up on JS over break.
peer review: Bria Harrold, Their isn't much going on here, but I can see what you were going for. Alot of the website isn't functional but you did good on the things that do work. At least you were able to pull the api's!!
